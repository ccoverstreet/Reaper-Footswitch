# Reaper Footswitch

This project is a ATmega32u4 based footswitch for sending keyboard commands to a computer. The primary use case is for sending keys to a DAW (Reaper in this case) to change which track is armed. This allows for switching between guitar tones easily without needing to press any keys and makes using guitar amp sims feel closer to the real thing.

## Parts

- ATmega32u4 based microcontroller (pick based on IO needs)
- USB to USB Micro-B cable
